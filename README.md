# Catalyst 8000 Wizard
A simple questionnaire application that helps in determining which Catalyst 8000 device you should consider based on your unique requirements.

## Project Inspiration
Considering the substantial differences between previous generations of Cisco routers (ASR 1000 Series & ISR 4000 Series) to the latest Catalyst 8000 Edge Platforms, I felt a tool to assist with migration/selection would be helpful. There isn't particularly a one-to-one swap, and a lot of variables can determine which device you actually need, but by answering a few questions, this application can put you on the right track.
